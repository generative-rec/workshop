bio: <b>Rui Li</b> is a senior staff engineer at Meta working on large scale recommendation models, systems, and products.  Before joining Meta, he worked at Yahoo! Research and YouTube Recommendation.  Rui earned his PhD in UIUC back in 2013 working on data mining, machine learning.  Rui is consistently interested in driving users' experiences and business values via practical machine learning in the search and recommendation area, published 20+ in top conferences including KDD, WWW, VLDB, and SIGIR. 
content-title: Actions Speak Louder than Words\: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers for Generative Recommendations
content-speak: Recommendation systems enable billions of people to make decisions on a daily basis in online content and e-commerce platforms. The scale of such systems have increased by close to 10,000x in the last few years. Despite these being the largest software systems on the planet (https://youtu.be/watch?v=txOv_pi-_R4&t=2020s as Jensen Huang remarked in NVIDIA's recent ER), most DLRM models donâ€™t scale with compute. 
Our work, Generative Recommenders, reformulates ranking and retrieval in recommendation systems as sequential transduction tasks while significantly outperforming traditional DLRMs for the first time. Our new architecture introduced, HSTU, outperforms SotA Transformers by up to 15.2x on 8k sequences, while our inference algorithm, M-FALCON, boosts inference efficiency by 900x vs traditional DLRMs thanks to a novel design that fully amortizes computational costs via micro-batching. 
Generative Recommenders and HSTU not only deliver double-digit improvements in online A/B tests at Meta, but also demonstrate scaling law in industrial-scale RecSys, up to GPT-3/LLaMa-2-compute scale, opening up new research frontiers through the application of scaling law.
